"ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DavidGloireEspoir. I am also a programmer and graphics designer. I have a strong interest in anything related to computing, coding, and graphics design. 
I am experienced in programming languages such as Java, C#, JavaScript, PHP, C++, C programming, and Arduino.

I consider myself a full stack developer, which means I can work on both the frontend and backend of a project.

Currently, I am a graduate student in software engineering, aiming to become a master in this field.

I am actively seeking collaboration opportunities with coding companies.

If you want to reach me, you can do so through the following channels:



Here are some of my projects that you can check out:

1. Simple PHP e-commerce shop with a payment gateway and MySQL database. You can download it from this link: (https://github.com/DavidGloire/PHP_simple_shop_cart-with-payment_Gateway_-_Mysql_database/blob/main/cart%20shop%20pay%20with%20Afripay%20PHP.zip)
2. Plane Reservation System implemented in Java. You can find the project on GitHub:  https://github.com/DavidGloire/JAVA-PLANE-RESERVATION-SYSTEM
3. Android Dart project that allows you to switch between Dark Mode and Light Mode. You can find the project on GitHub:  https://github.com/DavidGloire/Flutter-dart-Theme-DarkMode-LightMode/tree/main

Feel free to explore these projects and get in touch if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities."
